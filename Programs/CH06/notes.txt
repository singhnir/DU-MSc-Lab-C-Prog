/*
 * Figuring all the Constants
 * ------------------------- 
 * 
 * see which of the following are constants and keep function arguments compact
 *
 * integration limit
 * integration step size
 *
 * root finding interval
 */

/*
 * no of Variables in the questioned functions 
 * -------------------------------------------
 *
 * see how many variables and constants are there
 * define mathematical function's constants in Capital

/*
 * Writing a Mind Map 
 * ------------------
 *
 * before starting off know what functions + what order to write and combine, 
 * some of sample mind maps 
 * based on excersise problems
 *
 *  1. mathematical function 
 *      -> integrator 
 *       -> plot for integrator  
 *     
 *  2. mathematical function
 *      -> integrator (different integrators)
 *       -> compare accuracy (no fixed integration step - n) 
 *        -> print no of steps, result
 *     
 *  3. mathematical function 
 *      -> integrator 
 *       -> root_finding for the integration results 
 *        -> print roots 
 *     
 *  4. mathematical function 
 *      -> root_finding 
 *       -> roots as integrator's limits 
 *        -> plot for integrator
