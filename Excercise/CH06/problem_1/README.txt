Initially I made a flexible template that would suit for 
all kind of mind maps of problems presented in 
                                  Programs/CH06/notes.txt 
but I asked feedback from my friends and it was very (-_- 
In less than 30 mins, there's no need to write a general 
program yes I agree but in the same time I don't want to 
jumble + throw everything in main() to get output  so I 
updated all these programs to be concise with the questi
on replicating exam setting  but   keeping   essence  of 
learning. I'll be happy if someone helps with more re
adability.
